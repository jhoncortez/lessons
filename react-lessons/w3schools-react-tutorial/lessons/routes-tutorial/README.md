# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Router
**first run**
npm i -D react-router-dom

**Basic usage**
Use router in the index.js importing BrowserRouter, Routes and Route fron `react-router-dom`
We also import the pages

<pre>
import {BrowserRouter, Routes, Route} from "react-router-dom"
import Layout from "./pages/Layout";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import Blogs from "./pages/Blogs";
import Contact from "./pages/Contact";
import NoPage from "./pages/NoPage";
</p>

we'll use the **BrouserRouter** component, then we define our **Routes** component, an aplication can have multiple routes, we will use one.
Route component can be nested. The first Route has a path / and renders the Layout component

The nested Route inherut and add to the parent route. so the blogs path is combined with the parent and becomes /blogs

The Home component route does not have a path but has an index attribute. that specifies this route as the default route for the parent route, wich is /

Setting the path to * will act as a catch-all for any undefined URLs. This is great for a 4040 error page.

<pre>
<BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
            <Route index element={<Home />}>
            <Route path="blogs" element={<Blogs />}>
            <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />}>
            <Route path="*" element={<NoPage />}>
    </Routes>

</BrowserRouter>
